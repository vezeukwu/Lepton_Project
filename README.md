## Introduction
Lepton Enterprise is involved in office supplies and technology retail business, catering to various segments like consumers, corporate clients, and home offices. 
Their product categories include technology (e.g., phones, accessories), office supplies (e.g., paper, binders, chairs), and furniture, with a focus on workplace and home office solutions.

## Problem Statement
Lepton Enterprises is experiencing challenges in optimizing its profitability and revenue growth across different business segments, categories, and regions. The company lacks actionable insights into the drivers of profit and sales, including the impact of shipping modes, subcategory-level performance, and regional dynamics. This limits its ability to make data-driven decisions to prioritize high-performing areas, address underperforming segments, and align resources effectively with market demands.

Additionally, Lepton has some inconsistencies in trends of sales and profit distribution across its subcategories of products. The company expects a comprehensive analysis to identify key opportunities for maximizing profitability, improving cost efficiency, and driving revenue growth across diverse customer segments and shipping preferences.

## Task
To identify high-performing and underperforming areas across segments, product categories, shipping modes, and regions, the organization needed actionable insights. 

The objective was to uncover which product categories, customer segments, and operational strategies drive profitability and revenue, ensuring efficient resource allocation.

## Action
Evaluated profit contributions by segment, category, and shipping mode.

Visualized subcategory-level profit performance, highlighting high and low contributors (e.g., high profits from copiers and low profits from tables).

Compared product categories, with technology dominating profits, followed by office supplies.

Analyzed sales trends over time and across regions, revealing steady growth with peaks in 2018.

Explored sales contributions by product categories and subcategories, identifying strong sales in technology and storage items.

Reviewed shipping modes, showing Standard Class as the most utilized mode with the highest sales impact.

## Key Insights Derived
Consumers contribute the highest profit (46.5%), followed by the Corporate segment (32.67%). The Home Office segment (20.83%) lags behind, providing opportunity for tailored marketing to increase engagement and profitability.

Technology products dominate profitability (52.42%), followed by Office Supplies (41.48%). Furniture contributes only 6.1% of profits, which draws attention to the need to reassess pricing, inventory, or marketing strategies for this category.

High-performing subcategories are Copiers (22%), Phones (14%), and Accessories (15%) while Tables, with negative profitability, shows a critical area for improvement, requiring an evaluation of its costs, pricing, or market demand etc.

Revenue shows a steady upward trend from 2015 to 2018, with significant growth in 2018, with he West region leading in sales revenue, followed by the East and Central regions. The South region has the lowest sales.

## Recommendations
Improve Furniture Profitability by bundle selling furnitures with high-performing categories (e.g., Technology) to increase sales

Improve sales performance in the south

Optimize Shipping Costs by focusing on Standard Class shipping as it is the most cost-effective and preferred option. Then reassess the viability of Same Day shipping and consider phasing it out or limiting it to premium customers.

Reevaluate the discounting policies for subcategories like Tables to ensure profitability, while using data-driven insights to apply discounts strategically, focusing on products that drive both revenue and profit.

Expand offerings in Technology especially in trending products like laptops, phones, and accessories with a possibility of exploring partnerships with technology brands to boost product variety and exclusivity.

## Summary
Lepton Enterprise excels in technology and office supplies, with a strong regional presence in the West. However, there are clear opportunities to address underperforming product categories like furniture and improve regional and shipping performance in underutilized areas.
